The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning algorithm that accurately predicts the chances of suffering from a heart disease. Given above are the features mentioned in the dataset
I developed a Logistic Regression, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting model and compared the recall of every model to decide which model is ideal in predicting heart disease suffrage
I also developed a few visualizations as an initial exploratory data analysis. The dataset was taken from Kaggle.
